This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It contains main index.js file initiating the react script (running on port 3010).

I decided to use only two folder structure, as the complexity is very small.

The "container" folder holds all the elements while "store" reflects data manipulation.

Them main element is the "App.js", that initiates the data and loops through the data displaying filtered and sorted list.

I have created two helpers "input.js" and "select.js" that handles the user inputs.

"header.js" access the data manipulation like "sorting" and "filtering" and "form.js" manipulates with "Create/Update/Delete".

The "profile.js" is the view only element.


To handle data and actions I have used FLUX.
